Turn handwritten notes into editable text and downloadable PDFs.

## Project Description
VibeScribe is a productivity-focused note-taking application designed to help students save time while studying. The app allows users to upload images of handwritten or printed notes and convert them into editable digital text. Once converted, notes can be reviewed, edited, and exported as a PDF.

## Features
- Upload images of handwritten or printed notes  
- Convert images into editable digital text  
- Edit and review notes directly in the app  
- Export and download notes as a PDF file  
- Clean and simple user interface focused on productivity  

## Problem It Solves
Students often take notes as photos or handwritten pages and later have to retype everything manually. VibeScribe eliminates this extra step by converting images into digital notes that are easy to edit, organize, and download.

## How It Works
1. Upload a photo of your notes  
2. The app converts the image into editable text  
3. Edit or clean up the notes if needed  
4. Download the final version as a PDF
